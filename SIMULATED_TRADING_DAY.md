## 📊 **Learning Progress Throughout Day**

### Hour 1 (0-10 trades): **Discovery Phase**
- No adjustments yet
- Testing all strategies equally
- Recording baseline data

### Hour 2 (10-20 trades): **Pattern Emergence**
- First cooldown applied (SNAP)
- Win rates starting to differentiate
- No learning boost yet

### Hour 3 (20-35 trades): **Active Learning**
- Strategy correlations discovered
- First strategy switches suggested
- Symbol cooldowns taking effect
- Performance boosts applied

### Hour 4 (35-50 trades): **Adaptation**
- Regime change handled
- Macro events incorporated
- Recalibration if needed

### After Hours (50+ trades): **Evolution**
- Competition runs
- Best strategies breed
- Poor performers eliminated
- New variants for tomorrow

## 🎯 **Key Behaviors You'll See**

### ✅ **Smart Symbol Selection**
```
Before: SNAP, PLTR, F, SNAP, PLTR, F... (loop)
After: SNAP (fail) → cooldown → RXRX (diamond) → SPY (regime) → NEW_SYMBOL
```

### ✅ **Strategy Switching**
```
AAPL + momentum = fail
Learning: "Try mean_reversion on AAPL"
AAPL + mean_reversion = success
Correlation recorded for future use
```

### ✅ **Macro Awareness**
```
"Tariffs on steel" → Check positions → Exit X (US Steel)
"Fed rate hike likely" → Reduce tech exposure
"Celebrity scandal" → Exit consumer brands
```

### ✅ **Quick Diamond Exits**
```
BBIG +10% in 30 min → AUTO SELL (profit target)
PLUG -5% in 1 hour → AUTO SELL (stop loss)
Never holds diamonds overnight
```

## 🚨 **Potential Issues & Solutions**

### Issue: "No trades executing"

```

### Issue: "Same symbols repeating"
**You'll see:**
```
[Learning] SNAP cooling until 2025-09-25 (3 consecutive failures)
[AutoLoop] Skipping SNAP - in cooldown for 23 more hours
[AutoLoop] Searching for news-driven alternatives...
```

### Issue: "Bad streak"
**You'll see:**
```
[Learning] 7 consecutive losses detected
[Learning] Entering recalibration mode: Drawdown of 8.2% detected
[Learning] Thresholds raised, position sizes reduced 20%
[AutoLoop] Recalibration mode: Being extra cautious for 3 days
```

## 📈 **Expected Metrics**

### By End of Day 1:
- 40-60 trades
- 45-55% win rate  
- 5-10 symbols in cooldown
- 2-3 strategy correlations found
- 1 evolution cycle complete

### By End of Week:
- 200+ trades with full learning
- 55-65% win rate (improved)
- Complex strategy switching
- Macro pattern library built
- Elite strategies dominating

## 🎬 **The Experience**

**Morning**: Cautious exploration, diamond hunting
**Midday**: Learning kicks in, patterns emerge  
**Afternoon**: Full adaptation, regime awareness
**Close**: Evolution breeds tomorrow's strategies

The bot will feel like it's "waking up" throughout the day - starting mechanical, becoming intuitive, ending strategic.
