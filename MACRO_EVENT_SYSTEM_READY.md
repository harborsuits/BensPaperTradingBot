# ðŸš€ Macro Event Detection System - Ready!

## âœ… What We've Implemented:

### 1. **MacroEventAnalyzer** 
Detects and analyzes:
- **Tariff announcements** â†’ Impacts steel, aluminum, tech sectors
- **Fed policy changes** â†’ Affects banks (+), REITs (-), tech (-)
- **Regulatory actions** â†’ Tech, healthcare, financial impacts
- **Political controversies** â†’ Consumer brands, retail impacts

### 2. **Speaker Reliability Tracking**
- Tracks who said what and their accuracy over time
- Weights predictions based on historical reliability
- Updates after outcomes are known

### 3. **Sector-Aware Portfolio Management**
- Maps symbols to sectors automatically
- Calculates portfolio exposure by sector
- Suggests actions when macro events affect your sectors

### 4. **Enhanced News Nudge** (`/api/news/nudge`)
Now includes:
- Basic sentiment analysis
- Macro event pattern detection
- Portfolio-specific impact assessment
- Probability-weighted adjustments

### 5. **Portfolio Sector Breakdown** (`/api/portfolio/sectors`)
Shows:
- Sector exposure percentages
- Concentration risk warnings
- Diversification score

## ðŸ”§ How It Works:

### Example Flow: "Fed considering rate hike"

1. **News Arrives**: "Fed Chair signals potential rate increase"
   
2. **Pattern Match**: 
   - Event type: `fed_policy`
   - Certainty: "signals" = medium (60%)
   - Speaker: Fed Chair (85% historical accuracy)
   - Probability: 0.6 Ã— 0.85 = 51%

3. **Portfolio Impact**:
   - You hold: AAPL (tech), JPM (bank), O (REIT)
   - Expected: AAPL -2%, JPM +1%, O -1.5%
   
4. **Bot Action**:
   - Reduces AAPL position by 25%
   - Holds JPM (beneficiary)
   - Sets stop loss on O

5. **Learning**:
   - If rate hike happens â†’ Speaker reliability â†‘
   - Records actual price moves vs predictions
   - Evolution favors macro-aware strategies

## ðŸ“Š New Endpoints:

### 1. Test Macro Event Detection:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/news/nudge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "X",
    "events": [{
      "headline": "White House considering 25% tariffs on steel imports",
      "description": "Administration officials said tariffs likely",
      "sentiment": -0.5
    }]
  }'
```

### 2. Check Portfolio Sectors:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/portfolio/sectors
```

### 3. Record Outcome (for learning):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/macro/record-outcome \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "speaker": "Treasury Secretary",
    "eventType": "tariff",
    "prediction": -5,
    "outcome": -6.2
  }'
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Your Bot Now Understands:

1. **"Considering tariffs"** â†’ Check steel/aluminum exposure â†’ Exit or hedge

3. **"Antitrust probe"** â†’ Exit big tech â†’ Look for alternatives
4. **"Celebrity fired"** â†’ Check consumer brands â†’ Quick exit if exposed

When news breaks:
1. Bot identifies macro patterns
2. Checks portfolio exposure  
3. Calculates probability Ã— impact
4. Takes proportional action
