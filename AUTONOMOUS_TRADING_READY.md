# 🤖 Autonomous Trading Bot - Ready for Tomorrow!

## ✅ All Systems Fixed and Ready

### 1. **Dynamic Symbol Discovery** (Primary)
- ✅ Evolution winners get top priority (0.9 score)
- ✅ Diamonds scorer fixed - finds high-impact news on penny stocks
- ✅ News movers with sentiment analysis
- ✅ Scanner for penny stocks and volume movers

### 2. **AI-Powered Opportunity Search** (Secondary)
- ✅ Finds stocks with >2% moves and >1M volume
- ✅ Infers sentiment from price action
- ✅ Uses temporary lower thresholds (0.48)

### 3. **Technical Setups** (Last Resort)
- ✅ Only checks SPY, QQQ, AAPL, etc. if nothing else found
- ✅ This is NOT the primary strategy!

## 📊 Expected Behavior Tomorrow

**At Market Open (9:30 AM ET):**

1. AutoLoop will start automatically via scheduler
2. Every 30 seconds it will:
   - Check for penny stocks with news catalysts
   - Look for volume movers and big price changes
   - Score opportunities using AI judgment
   - Execute small test trades to start learning

## 🎯 Focus on Low-Value Stocks

The bot prioritizes:
- **Penny stocks** (<$5) with unusual volume
- **News catalysts** scored by diamonds system
- **High volatility** opportunities with clear sentiment

## 🔍 Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check if AutoLoop is running
pm2 status

# Watch live activity
pm2 logs benbot-backend --lines 100

# Filter for trading activity
pm2 logs benbot-backend | grep -E "Found|BUY|SELL|Order|AI Analysis|diamonds"

# Check recent trades
curl http://localhost:4000/api/trades | jq '.items[0:5]'

# Check paper account
curl http://localhost:4000/api/paper/account | jq '.'
```

## ⚡ Manual Start (if needed)

If AutoLoop doesn't start at 9:30 AM:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/autoloop/start
```

## 🚦 Success Indicators

You'll see messages like:
- "🔍 Using AI judgment to find opportunities..."
- "💎 Found diamonds: [symbol list]"
- "📈 Found X significant movers"
- "✅ AI found opportunity in [SYMBOL]!"
- "Order placed for [SYMBOL]"

## ⚠️ Common Issues

1. **No trades executing**
   - Check if market is open
   - Verify AutoLoop is running: `pm2 status`
   - Check for errors: `pm2 logs benbot-backend --err`

2. **Only seeing same symbols**
   - This is fixed! Bot now tracks failures and moves on
   - After 3 failures, symbol is ignored for 1 hour

3. **No news data**
   - Expected if MARKETAUX_API_KEY not set
   - Bot will use AI market analysis instead

## 🎉 What Makes This Bot Smart

1. **Learns from failures** - Won't keep trying failed symbols
2. **Adapts to market** - Finds opportunities through multiple methods
3. **Risk management** - Small positions, especially for first trades
4. **Sentiment inference** - AI judges market mood from price action
5. **Evolution integration** - Uses winning strategies from competitions

The bot is now truly autonomous and will actively search for opportunities!
