Simple test for forex strategy market regime compatibility.

This script verifies that our six forex strategies:
1. Trend Following Strategy 
2. Range Trading Strategy
3. Breakout Strategy
4. Momentum Strategy
5. Scalping Strategy
6. Swing Trading Strategy

Are properly optimized for different market regimes and provide complementary coverage.
