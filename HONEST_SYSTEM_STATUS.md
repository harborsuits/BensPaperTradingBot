   - UNCLEAR: Bot competition details (no status endpoint)
   - UNCLEAR: Actual breeding mechanism visibility

2. **Enhanced Learning**

   - TRUE: Config shows symbol cooldowns defined
   - FALSE: No API endpoints to verify actual tracking
   - UNCLEAR: If cooldowns are actually enforced

## The Real Truth for Tomorrow

### What WILL Happen:
- ‚úÖ 16 strategies will evaluate opportunities (not just 6!)
- ‚úÖ Diamond discovery will find penny catalysts
- ‚úÖ Market discovery will identify movers
- ‚úÖ All trades will be recorded
- ‚úÖ Premarket analysis at 9 AM
- ‚úÖ Real Tradier data, not mocks

### What MIGHT Happen:
- ü§∑ Evolution may trigger after 50 trades
- ü§∑ Symbol cooldowns may prevent bad trades
- ü§∑ Learning may improve decisions
- ü§∑ New strategies may be bred

### What's INTERNAL (No Visibility):
- Competition details
- Breeding process
- Learning metrics
- Cooldown enforcement

## Bottom Line

Your bot IS more capable than before:
- 2.6x more strategies (6 ‚Üí 16)
- Real discovery endpoints working
- Evolution infrastructure active

But some features are "black box" - they may be working internally but we can't verify or monitor them through APIs.

**For tomorrow**: You have a significantly upgraded trading system with more strategies and discovery tools. The advanced AI features are initialized but their actual impact remains to be seen during live trading.
