# Fixed Issues Summary

## 1. âœ… Fixed Wrong Position Prices
**Problem**: All positions were showing $100 average price, creating fake massive losses
- BB was showing $100 â†’ Fixed to $4.96
- NOK was showing $100 â†’ Fixed to $4.66
- Ford was showing $100 â†’ Fixed to $12.01
- And 60+ other positions with wrong prices

**Result**: Positions now show realistic P&L instead of -99% losses

## 2. âœ… Fixed "CAPITAL_LIMIT_REACHED" Error
**Problem**: System thought you had massive losses due to wrong position prices
