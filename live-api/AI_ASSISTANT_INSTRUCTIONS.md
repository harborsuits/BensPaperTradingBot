./verify-system-integrity.sh
```

If this fails, DO NOT PROCEED. Ask the user for guidance.

### 2. Check What's Running
```bash
# Check if servers are running
lsof -ti:4000  # Backend
lsof -ti:3003  # Frontend

# Check system status
curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/health | jq
```

### 3. Read Protected Files Manifest
