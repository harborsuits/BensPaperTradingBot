# Server Status and Fixes Applied

## Current Situation

1. **Server Choice**: We decided to fix `server.js` (163 endpoints) rather than switch to `minimal_server.js` (140 endpoints) to avoid feature regression

2. **Fixes Applied**: 
   - Added paperBroker checks to `/api/paper/account` endpoint
   - Added paperBroker checks to `/api/paper/positions` endpoint
   - These checks prioritize local data over Tradier API calls

3. **Current Issues**:
   - Server appears to be failing to start properly
   - Connection refused errors when trying to access endpoints
   - Position price fixes are in `paper-positions.json` but not being served

## What Was Fixed

### Paper Account Endpoint
- Now checks `paperBroker` first before falling back to Tradier
- Returns consistent data structure
- Uses realistic position prices from the fixed JSON file

### Paper Positions Endpoint  
- Now checks `paperBroker` first before falling back to Tradier
- Calculates P&L using correct average prices
- Shows realistic market values

## Next Steps

1. **Debug Server Startup**: Need to identify why server isn't starting properly
2. **Verify Evolution Endpoints**: Check if evolution endpoints (404 errors) are accessible
3. **Test Quote Batching**: Verify the frontend quote batching fix is working

## Architecture Decision Made

✅ **Keep using server.js** - Preserves all 163 endpoints and features
❌ **Don't switch to minimal_server.js** - Would lose 23 endpoints

## Files Updated
- `server.js` - Added paperBroker checks
- `paper-positions.json` - Fixed average prices (BB: $4.96, NOK: $4.66, etc.)
- `new-trading-dashboard/src/contexts/DataSyncContext.tsx` - Added quote batching

## Server Architecture Issue Remains

You still have multiple competing server files:
- server.js (main)
- minimal_server.js
- simple_server.js  
- server_simple.js
- opportunities-server.js

This needs to be cleaned up eventually to prevent future confusion.
