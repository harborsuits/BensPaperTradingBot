# Solution: Switch to minimal_server.js

## Current Issues

1. **server.js won't start** - Multiple syntax errors from failed fixes
2. **UI has no data** - Backend not running
3. **Split architecture** - Different servers have different implementations
4. **Production uses minimal_server.js** - Your ecosystem.config already points to it!

## The Solution

Instead of fighting with server.js, let's use **minimal_server.js** which:
- Already has paper trading fixes
- Is what production (Railway) uses
- Is specified in ecosystem.config.js
- Is more maintainable (5,251 lines vs 8,079 lines)

## How to Switch

```bash
# Stop current broken backend
pm2 stop benbot-backend

# Delete and re-add using ecosystem config (which uses minimal_server.js)
pm2 delete benbot-backend
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --only benbot-api

# Or if you want to keep using server.js locally:
pm2 start server.js --name benbot-backend
```

## Missing Endpoints

minimal_server.js is missing these 23 endpoints from server.js:
- Some crypto endpoints
- Some options endpoints
- Some specialized proofs endpoints

If you need these, we can port them over.

## Data Flow Fix

For Tradier-first checking (as you requested):
1. Tradier API is checked first
2. Local PaperBroker is only used as fallback
3. This maintains production compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Immediate fix** - minimal_server.js already works
2. **Aligned with production** - Same server everywhere
3. **Maintainable** - Smaller, cleaner codebase
4. **No more split** - One server to rule them all

## Your Choice

Do you want to:
1. Switch to minimal_server.js (recommended, quick fix)
2. Keep debugging server.js (will take longer)
3. Create a new unified server (best long-term, most work)
