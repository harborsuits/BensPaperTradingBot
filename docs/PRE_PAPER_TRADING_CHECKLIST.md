# Pre-Paper Trading Checklist

This document serves as a pre-flight checklist to validate that all critical components are properly configured and ready before enabling paper trading mode.

## System Integrity Checks

### 1. Credentials and Security

- [ ] All API keys are stored in environment variables or secure credential storage
- [ ] No API keys are hardcoded in any source files
- [ ] SecureLogger is configured and masking sensitive information
- [ ] All broker API connections are using secure TLS/HTTPS

### 2. Data Validation

- [ ] Data validator is enabled and configured
- [ ] Price reasonability checks are active
- [ ] Stale data detection is configured
- [ ] Market hours awareness is enabled for appropriate asset classes

### 3. Risk Controls

- [ ] Emergency controls are enabled
- [ ] Kill switch functionality has been tested
- [ ] Position limits are set for each symbol
- [ ] Daily loss limits are configured appropriately
- [ ] Circuit breakers are active with appropriate thresholds

### 4. Position Management

- [ ] Position reconciler is active
- [ ] Local and broker positions are properly synced
- [ ] Position discrepancy detection and handling is implemented

### 5. Order Execution

- [ ] Order router is properly configured
- [ ] Execution simulator parameters are properly calibrated
- [ ] Latency and slippage are accounted for
- [ ] Failed order handling is implemented

### 6. Monitoring and Reporting

- [ ] Recap reporting service is enabled
- [ ] Email notifications are configured
- [ ] Necessary performance metrics are being recorded
- [ ] Transaction cost analysis is active

### 7. Infrastructure Readiness

- [ ] All required services (MongoDB, Redis, etc.) are running
- [ ] System has adequate resources (CPU, memory, network)
- [ ] File system permissions allow writing to log and data directories
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures are in place

## Pre-Flight Tests

Run these tests before enabling paper trading:

### Integration Test

```bash
python -m tests.integration.end_to_end_test
```

Verify that:

- All components communicate properly
- Market data flows through the system
- Orders are created and processed
- Positions are tracked correctly
- No errors occur during normal operation

### Kill Switch Test

```bash
python -m tests.validation.kill_switch_test
```

Verify that:

- Kill switch activates when risk limits are exceeded
- Trading stops immediately when kill switch is activated
- Emergency controls function as expected

### Data Validation Test

```bash
python -m tests.validation.data_validator_test
```

Verify that:

- Bad data is detected and filtered
- Stale data is identified
- Price spikes are properly flagged

## Required Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your paper trading environment:

```bash
# Broker API credentials
TRADING_ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_key
TRADING_ALPACA_API_SECRET=your_alpaca_secret
TRADING_TRADIER_API_KEY=your_tradier_key

# Email notifications (optional)
TRADING_EMAIL_SERVER=smtp.example.com
TRADING_EMAIL_PORT=587
TRADING_EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
TRADING_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
TRADING_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=recipient1@example.com,recipient2@example.com

# Application settings
TRADING_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
TRADING_MODE=paper
TRADING_INITIAL_CAPITAL=100000
```

## Final Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Integration test passed successfully
- [ ] Kill switch test passed successfully
- [ ] Data validation test passed successfully
- [ ] All environment variables are properly set
- [ ] System startup produces no errors or warnings
- [ ] Position and risk limits are appropriately conservative for initial paper trading
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are fully functional

## Post-Paper Trading Analysis

After enabling paper trading, regularly review these metrics:

1. Execution quality (slippage, latency)
2. Position tracking accuracy
3. Risk limit effectiveness
4. Data quality and timeliness
5. System resource utilization
6. Strategy performance against benchmarks

Document any issues or adjustments needed before transitioning to live trading.
