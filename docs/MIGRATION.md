# Trading Bot Reorganization Migration

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of the trading bot codebase to the new, more organized structure. The migration is being done incrementally to maintain system stability while improving code organization.

## Migration Status

| Component | Status | Completion | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Strategy Organization | In Progress | 15% | Basic framework implemented |
| Data Processing | In Progress | 20% | Core components in place |
| Configuration System | In Progress | 30% | Unified config created |
| CLI Consolidation | In Progress | 25% | Command structure defined |
