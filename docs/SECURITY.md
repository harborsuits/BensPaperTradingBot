# BensBot Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for deploying and maintaining BensBot in a production environment.

## Containerized Deployment Security

The BensBot system has been configured with advanced security features:

### 1. HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

The system uses Nginx as a reverse proxy with automatic SSL certificate provisioning via Let's Encrypt:

- HTTP traffic is automatically redirected to HTTPS
- Modern TLS parameters are used for secure communication
- Security headers are set to prevent common web vulnerabilities
- Certificates are automatically renewed

To initialize SSL certificates:

```bash
# 1. Edit init-letsencrypt.sh to set your domain and email
# 2. Run the initialization script
./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

### 2. Network Isolation

The Docker Compose configuration implements network isolation:

- `public-network`: Only accessible by services that need external communication
- `bensbot-network`: Internal communication between application services
- `bensbot-private-network`: Private network for database access only (internal, no external access)

### 3. Volume Encryption (Production Systems)

For production systems with sensitive financial data, encrypt the data volumes:

#### Linux LUKS Encryption Setup

```bash
# Create an encrypted container
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat --type luks2 /path/to/container

# Open the encrypted container
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /path/to/container bensbot_encrypted

# Create filesystem
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/bensbot_encrypted

# Mount the filesystem
sudo mount /dev/mapper/bensbot_encrypted /Users/bendickinson/Desktop/Trading:BenBot/volumes

# Update docker-compose volumes to use this mount point
```

### 4. Resource Limits

The Docker Compose file includes resource limits for all services to prevent resource exhaustion attacks:

- CPU limits prevent any single service from consuming excessive CPU
- Memory limits protect against memory leaks and denial of service
- Reservations ensure minimum resources for critical services

### 5. Credential Rotation Policy

It's recommended to regularly rotate all credentials:

1. **API Keys**: Rotate broker API keys quarterly or after personnel changes
2. **Database Passwords**: Change MongoDB and Redis passwords monthly
3. **JWT Secret**: Generate a new secret key at least quarterly
4. **Admin Credentials**: Change dashboard admin password monthly

#### Steps for Credential Rotation

1. Generate new credentials for the target system
2. Update the `.env` file with new values
3. Update the `CREDENTIALS_ROTATION_TIMESTAMP` environment variable in docker-compose.yml
4. Restart the affected services: `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate <service-name>`
5. Verify system functionality after rotation
6. Document the rotation in a secure change log

### 6. Health Checks and Monitoring

All services have health checks configured to ensure they're operating properly:

- Failed health checks will trigger automatic restarts
- Monitor container health status with: `docker-compose ps`
- Set up external monitoring to alert on container failures

## Security Checklist for Production Deployment

- [ ] All default credentials have been changed
- [ ] SSL certificates are properly configured
- [ ] Volume encryption is enabled for sensitive data
- [ ] MongoDB authentication is enabled and using strong passwords
- [ ] Redis password is set and sufficiently complex
- [ ] JWT_SECRET_KEY has been generated using a cryptographically secure method
- [ ] Admin username is not the default "admin"
- [ ] Admin password meets complexity requirements
- [ ] Network segmentation is correctly configured
- [ ] Resource limits have been adjusted based on host capabilities
- [ ] Credential rotation schedule has been established
- [ ] Backup procedures have been tested and validated
